## Description
This is an open-source AI for StarCraft 2, utilizing [Blizzard's API](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-api) and [DeepMind's RL Toolkit](https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2). Emphasis will be on strategy so the bot is eventually capable of high-level play at human Actions Per Minute (APM).

## Goals
- Minimal/no hardcoding
- Parse and categorize replays
- Identify and classify likely early enemy strategy
- Utilize classifier to train time-constrained strategies to counter or out-pace enemy strategy
- Identify early, mid, and late game for strategic adjustments
- Scout, harass, and macro based on replays
- Fine-tune strategies utilizing training environments
- Defeat novice -> good -> professional players
